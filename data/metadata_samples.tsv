But does art direction still exist? Or, does it exist like it could? With the rise of social media, rapid turnarounds, cheap stock image options, mood boards and social media calendars, multivariate testing, and a whole chunk of the industry just banging out work to stay alive, are we doing a good enough job with the ideas people see?  Meet Cathy Heng, an art director recognized by D&AD, Cannes, the British Arrows, and the IPA Effectiveness Awards. She even featured in Campaign’s ‘Top 100’ Hall of Fame for her work on BMW.  We discuss what art direction is, how it happens, good examples, and how to do it better.

This week’s guest is a leader in the relatively recent field of fixed income ESG investing, as well as the new area of impact investing in public fixed income markets, where bond proceeds are directed to a specific project or goal and the results are measurable. He is Stephen Liberatore, lead portfolio manager at TIAA Investments for responsible investment fixed income mandates that incorporate ESG criteria.

The investment horizon, even for people in retirement can stretch into decades. Plus, in this era of passive index investing, a firm’s culture, its independence of thought,  investment discipline, and integrity are going to matter even more. As Sir John Templeton said “If you want to have a better performance than the crowd, you must do things differently from the crowd.”   And that frequently means “To buy when others are despondently selling and sell when others are greedily buying…” which he said “…requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest reward. “ That approach takes a certain mindset and training which is why for this WEALTHTRACK exclusive we have asked great investor Bill Miller to join us with his Co-Portfolio Manager Samantha McLemore.

In recognition, the Federal Reserve just cut interest rates for the second time this summer and remains on alert. Another largely unrecognized concern? In August, for the first time in history, assets in passive equity funds based in the U.S. surpassed holdings in actively managed funds. The most popular passive funds are overwhelmingly dominated by a small group of mega-cap stocks, especially the tech giants such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. The fate of many investors’ portfolios hinges on the performance of this small group of mega stocks that have already had a record-setting run.

What will the 2020s bring? As J.P. Morgan famously said: “Stocks will fluctuate.”  In 2019 they fluctuated mostly higher and the U.S. was still the place to be. Tech giants such as FANG’s Facebook, up 56%, Google’s parent Alphabet, up 29% and Amazon.com up 23% propelled the NASDAQ 35% higher. The S&P 500 rose nearly 27% and the Dow Jones Industrials advanced over 22%, all trading in record territory. It was pretty much a year for stocks all over the world, which is, of course, bringing the doomsayers out in droves. An excellent article on the front page of The Wall Street Journal’s Year-end Review & Outlook section is a good example. It’s titled: “Japan’s Lost 30 Years Give Pause To Those Looking at The U.S.” What are the stories propelling economies and markets in 2020 and the decade going to be? It’s a podcast conversation we had with Nobel Laureate economist Robert Shiller about how important powerful narratives driving the economy are. WEALTHTRACK #1627 published on January 03, 2020.

What was it like telling the team? Did they step away from derby or stay close by? How quickly did they return to skating?  Roller derby isn't every part of our lives, but it DOES make our lives better. You can carve out time for you and time for family. If you set boundaries, you really CAN have it all.

Being a stranger in the world is what it means to be without Christ in our journey. A stranger in the world is exiled from Him and from home.

Forgive seventy times seven? This does not mean 490 times, but boundless forgiveness, that we travel with forgiveness for those who have wronged us. Forgiveness is not always easy, especially when we have been deeply hurt or wronged or if we live in a situation where we are poorly treated continually, but the Lord’s command to forgive is one that can free and heal our hearts and cultivate boundless love for our neighbors. 	33.53686666666667	show_2Mkrfx6HroyJiFjCnSRkOF	1SuDO8PpHWw90C5EkQvnjc

We have stories and sayings that we can’t always connect. But in today’s study we can see things in sequence, which adds meaning to the story. This includes the feeding of the 5,000, the rescue of the apostles while they are struggling against great winds on the Sea of Galilee, and the Bread of Life speech which motivated many of Jesus’s followers to desert Him. 	27.71635	show_2Mkrfx6HroyJiFjCnSRkOF	1Uv30uHn2oq7DGRywyZ1rN

Two investment tenets have been upended in recent years: one that value stocks, considered cheap by traditional metrics outperform growth stocks, the other that small companies outperform large ones. Over the last decade, the opposite has been true. Growth stocks have dramatically outdistanced value stocks and large caps have significantly outperformed small company ones. If you happen to be a value-oriented, small-cap investor it’s been a tough combination which is why contrarian minded observers think now might be a good time to revisit the space.

A favorite piece of gear or pair of skates? A shark punching moment? It could be anything that is special to you.

Voicemail: Leave me a voice message by going to this link on Safari web browser: https://anchor.fm/power-through-the-4th-whistle or look up our show on the Anchor app.  2.

I can take the audio off it no problem. 3. Social Media: Post your video on social media and tag @power4thwhistle on Instagram or Twitter or our FB page on FB with the #powergratitude. If you want to make sure I found it, send me a lil message. ;-)  4. DM: If none of these sound appealing, just send a written message on FB or e-mail or DM on Twitter @power4thwhistle or Instagram @power4thwhistle. Deadline is the Tuesday night before Thanksgiving.

And we will be looking at one particular very wonderful thing Paul taught:  “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” 	33.75978333333333	show_2Mkrfx6HroyJiFjCnSRkOF	2CpRjWbLIuUcH5OpPG23uo

We also invite a leading portfolio manager to join him. For the fourth year in a row, First Eagle’s Matthew McLennan is doing the honors. This week we are presenting the second of our two-part series focused on the global economic and investment outlook. In case you missed it, we tackled the 2020 prospects for the U.S. economy and markets last week which you can see on WEALTHTRACK.com or our YouTube channel.  In part one of our 2020 Outlook edition, Hyman predicted, as he did accurately for 2019, that the longest economic recovery on record in the U.S. would continue. He sees no signs of recession and believes that growth will actually pick up! He also forecasts that Wall Street will continue to climb a wall of worry, which he will describe in detail. Matt McLennan is not as optimistic. One of his main concerns is the record levels of government and corporate debt in the U.S. and the problems it poses to future growth and liquidity, especially in the event of a slowdown. After the record-setting bull market run he also believes the U.S. market is expensive. He is investing very selectively in super high quality, market-dominant companies. He has a stash of cash to take advantage of sizable market declines and a significant position in gold to offset market risk. We will start our global outlook discussion this week with one of the biggest headline events of 2019 - Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “Get Brexit Done” victory in the United Kingdom which Hyman thinks has worldwide significance.  ---   Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support	26.750166666666665	show_4zwERdBdLsB57sSLU7dlFR	2D6IIHZV52wF0sHNfjRyCZ

Health care costs are skyrocketing and they hit seniors particularly hard because many are on a fixed income and they utilize health care more. But Medicare is not a slam dunk, anything but.  It is a very complex, confusing multipart program that requires work to understand. And its benefits can vary widely depending upon how and when you apply, where you live, and what plans you enroll in.  And as your health changes, it can either help you or hurt you. You need to know how to make it work for you. A shocking statistic from Medicare guru Katy Votava is that “nearly 95% of people pay too much for their Medicare coverage… because they do not completely understand the full costs they will pay in addition to the premiums.”  With Medicare, the devil is in the details which is why we have asked benefits guru Votava to return to WEALTHTRACK and bring us up to speed.

We are running part 2 this weekend.   Rosenberg had been predicting the end of both the record-breaking U.S. recovery and bull market this year. Needless-to-say it hasn’t happened, and he is the first to admit he missed this year’s impressive run in large-cap stocks as a result. However, his recommendation to own long-term Treasury bonds has paid off. Year-to-date the 30-year has delivered about a 20% return.   Rosenberg who is known for seeing emerging economic patterns before most others do, sometimes a couple of years early, is sticking to his guns in forecasting that a U.S. recession is imminent and is very concerned about the damage the record-breaking load of U.S. and global debt, what he  calls “the mother of all credit bubbles on steroids” will have when it occurs.     What was intended as one session with us turned into two because he had so much evidence to share about global and domestic conditions and the state of the financial markets.   Last week he made his case for recession. This week his focus extends to the markets and recession resilient investments.     As we mentioned last week, Rosenberg is launching his own macro research and strategy firm in January, Rosenberg Research and Associates. He explains why he decided to make that long-held dream a reality in our EXTRA feature on WEALTHTRACK.com. In the meantime, he remains as Chief Economist and Strategist at Toronto based wealth management firm, Gluskin Sheff.

Off the field, Sky Blue's move to Red Bull Arena fully ushers in a new, more professional era for the team. General manager Alyse LaHue has been at the forefront of this overhaul. She joined EQZ founder Jeff Kassouf on Podcast Row in Baltimore to discuss the club's transformation. We talk a lot about allocation money in the middle of this episode. Here's more information on the initial announcement of allocation money, with further details that EQZ reported coming out of the draft in Baltimore.

Among these new converts were polytheistic Gentiles who had once worshipped idols, Jews who held to the Mosaic law, and all of the ideas influenced by the philosophies of Greece.

Names such as Dean Witter, Kidder Peabody, PaineWebber, and Smith Barney were thriving independents. No more!

It is Tweedy, Browne Company   Although they are both traditional long-term value investors there is nothing old fashioned about their performance.  Buffett’s partner Charlie Munger once described Tweedy Browne as “…absolute spiritual descendants of Ben Graham… they are like Buddhists or Tibetan monks who absolutely bought into the catechism.” Classic value investing – delivering modern outperformance.  In a WEALTHTRACK exclusive, Tweedy, Browne’s senior portfolio managers explain their Ben Graham/Warren Buffett approach.

Sinai at 2:00 o’clock that morning.  We pulled over to rest.  We got off the main road and pulled up onto a small hill.  We watched from our perch, as an occasional car would go by.  And then it happened.  We watched as a dark mist or fog rolled in like a slow-motion wave of the sea.  We were both wide awake now—the mist completely obscured our view of the road below us—we could no longer see headlights or anything.  It was almost an inky black. This was the mist of darkness Lehi had talked about! 	33.90825	show_2Mkrfx6HroyJiFjCnSRkOF	2wE5sZXN8cntYT7XjBOD81

For the fourth year in a row, our choice is First Eagle’s, Matthew McLennan. In the first of this two-part series on the Outlook for 2020, our focus is on the U.S. Last year Hyman correctly forecast the now record-breaking economic recovery would continue and that a recession was several years away. We’ll find out what his view is now and get McLennan’s assessment of the U.S. markets. Ed Hyman is a Wall Street legend. Vice-Chairman of Evercore, a leading independent investment banking and advisory firm, Hyman is the Founder and Chairman of its Evercore ISI division and leads its economic research team. He has been voted Wall Street’s Number One Economist for an unprecedented 39 years in Institutional Investor’s annual survey. No one else comes even close to that record. Matthew McLennan, a noted global value manager is Head of the Global Value Team at First Eagle Investment Management where he oversees more than ninety billion dollars in assets, including several funds. His flagship First Eagle Global Fund which he inherited from legendary value investor Jean-Marie Eveillard in 2008 carries Morningstar’s Five Star and Bronze Medalist Analyst ratings and has outperformed both its World Stock Index and World Allocation category since its 1979 inception.

But the cumulative real growth of the economy, that’s excluding inflation, is far below other post World War II recoveries. That growth is now being challenged on several fronts - enough to derail the U.S. economy and the record-breaking bull market in large-cap stocks? In a slow-growth world, growth commands a premium. Large-cap growth stocks, particularly the largest U.S. ones known as mega-caps have dominated market performance, revenues, and earnings over the last decade with a few short-lived challenges from value stocks. Will they continue to do so? This week’s guest is a newcomer to WEALTHTRACK, but not to the investment business. She is Margaret Vitrano, Co-Portfolio Manager of the high performing ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund Vitrano and her Co-Portfolio Manager Peter Bourbeau also oversee ClearBridge’s All Cap Growth Strategies along with Large Cap Growth which adds up to nearly $50 billion under management. Of particular interest is the team's “three-bucket” approach strategy to large-cap growth which Vitrano believes has protected their portfolios in down markets. She will also discuss their treatment of the FAANGs in their portfolios and why they are currently overweighting Facebook. WEALTHTRACK # 1615 broadcast on October 11, 2019.

Answers From Two Retirement Experts	There is a retirement crisis in this country. It is becoming more apparent as 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day. A recent Wells Fargo survey found that more than eight in ten current retirees fund their retirement primarily with Social Security, or a pension; just 5% do so from personal savings such as an IRA or 401(k). Seven in ten retirees say they would have “no idea what they would do” without Social Security. Contrast them with younger generations who expect savings to be the top source of their funding; 45% of millennials say they must rely on IRAs or 401(k)s and only 25% expect to rely on Social Security or a pension. No matter what income group you look at savings makes a huge difference. The top 10% of savers in all income groups, from the highest to the lowest consistently held 10-20 times the retirement wealth of the bottom 10% of savers. What has caused the retirement crisis and are there policy and personal solutions to fix it? Two retirement experts will join us with some answers. Teresa Ghilarducci is a Professor of Economics at the New School for Social Research where she is Director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis (SCEPA) and the Retirement Equity Lab (ReLab), which researches the causes and consequences of the retirement crisis. Ghilarducci is a co-author with former WEALTHTRACK guest, Tony James of Rescuing Retirement: A Plan to Guarantee Retirement Security for All Americans. Jamie Hopkins is Director of Retirement Research at Carson Wealth, and Finance Professor of Practice at Creighton University College of Business. Hopkins a frequent WEALTHTRACK guest is an expert on retirement income and author of Rewirement: Rewiring the Way You Think About Retirement.  WEALTHTRACK #1624 broadcast on December 13, 2019.

This week, Dan Lauletta and Chelsey Bush tackled the depth in the USWNT midfield, whether or not a player should be subbed if actively bleeding from the mouth, as well as notes and analysis on Washington's victory over Sky Blue, Houston's taking down of Utah, and Portland adding to Orlando's misery. In addition, John Halloran and Claire Watkins tuned in from immediate post-game at SeatGeek Stadium to talk through the Chicago Red Stars win over a (dare we say?) struggling North Carolina Courage squad. Things are heating up from here, don't miss it.  ---   This episode is sponsored by  · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast.  https://anchor.fm/app 	48.04053333333334	show_4lbnMhRAmkGBxpGOb6yFAx	3vijdHm5jk3bsWBFSSbwGU

Industry Veteran Tom Petrie’s Reality Check	If you were to follow legendary investor Sir John Templeton’s advice to buy where there is maximum pessimism it might lead you to energy stocks. The energy sector has lagged the S&P 500 since 2016 and has been one of the worst if not the worst-performing industry sectors over the last year. The fossil fuel industry has been hit with an almost perfect storm of headwinds and instability among major petroleum producers outside of the U.S. The ongoing trade wars between the U.S. and China have also started to take their toll on global economic growth, increasing the downward pressure on demand for fuel. What’s the outlook for traditional energy producers? Are they still viable investments or are they on their way to being phased out? Joining us to discuss the role fossil fuels continue to play in energy production and the state of the oil and gas industry, in particular, is Tom Petrie, a financial thought leader in the sector and chairman of Petrie Partners a leading investment banking and consulting boutique to the oil and gas industry. Petrie is the author of Following Oil: Four Decades of Cycle-Testing Experiences and What They Foretell about U.S. Energy Independence.  WEALTHTRACK #1617 broadcast on October 25, 2019 More info: https://wealthtrack.com/political-economic-pressures-on-oil-gas-stocks-industry-veteran-tom-petries-reality-check/  ---   Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/wealthtrack/support	26.398000000000003	show_4zwERdBdLsB57sSLU7dlFR	41iwZzI6lh34srkGAberMV

The topic this week is Bravery. Bravery is feeling the fear and doing it anyway. Today we are going to talk a lot about responding to fear, how to combat fear, and even which risks are worth taking and which aren’t. Sports can bring out the best in people. You can learn to overcome your self doubts and fears and let your light shine brightly. You end up inspiring others whether you know it or not. But bravery can be small everyday things too. (🎼 ""I wanna see you be brave...."" 🎼)  A little more about our special guest:  Lady Trample is the founder of Chicks in Bowls. She is an exceptional roller derby jammer who started with Pirate City Rollers, competed in multiple playoffs and championship games for Victorian Roller Derby League, and recently transferred to Denver Roller Derby. She was awarded MVP at the 2017 WFTDA Championship. She played for Aotearoa Roller Derby at the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup where she was named Tournament Fan Favorite.

John the Baptist is preaching his hopeful and important message. He is a voice in the wilderness, which has come to mean in our English language, someone who is expressing an idea that is not popular. Yet, it is the message that Israel has anticipated for its entire history, “Prepare ye the way of the Lord.” The Messiah is here. 	30.6769	show_2Mkrfx6HroyJiFjCnSRkOF	4OkGKXNcfERCUI1tn5C6j7

Chicago and Portland drew 4-4 in a wild match that said many things (and sometimes very little) about two heavy NWSL hitters. This week also featured two 1-0 score-lines, the first favoring the Houston Dash over Sky Blue, the second finding the Utah Royals in victory over the Washington Spirit. And finally, Reign FC drew the Orlando Pride 1-1 (a good result for the Pride after a 5-0 thrashing at the hands of the North Carolina Courage mid-week). Clearly, Chelsey Bush and Claire Watkins had a lot to talk about in how Chicago put it all together, whether or not Sky Blue is improving, the value of Christen Press, and the Pride's highs and lows.

Number two is, is it a good time to d begin to do some reduction of risk in the portfolio? And I think the warning signs are Yes."" SARGEN: ""What I'm concerned with today is that I think there is no solution in sight. We are at a complete standoff. We are playing brinksmanship. And just today, the president makes a statement. I never thought I'd hear that U.S. businesses should stop doing business with China."" SARGEN: ""In my view, the upside for the stock market is limited because if the economy slowing, profits are slowing, they're not going to be robust as they have been. And then the real risk to the downside. I think the Fed tries to provide support. But if the trade war keeps going the wrong direction, I see the risk is basically a replay of what happened in the fourth quarter of last year.""

There's still work to do but it will give you a sense of the attitude of the book.  There are two main sections to the book. The first half focuses on 24 words that I find strategists and account planners using (or needing to use) in their work (clarity, meaning, truth, impostor, lonewolf, etc). It's surreal philosophy of sorts. I want it to feel like I'm in your head because I'm channeling hundreds - maybe thousands - of conversations, emails, and meetings. The second half of the book is more practical. It compiles frameworks from my ""Strategy! The Workout"" training sessions, helps you understand how to apply them, while also breaking down what ideas, problems, insights, and strategy statements are.  I want to get ""Strategy Is Your Words"" onto desks and walls (posters) around the world. There will be a digital version but... I want you to touch this and be able to point to it.  I'm just starting on launch and marketing plans. I'm open to ideas :) Enjoy.  Mark     For more strategy talk: 1. Strategy newsletter: http://www.markpollard.net/email-newsletter/ 2. Strategy drawings: http://www.instagram.com/markpollard  3.

This week, Jess and I talk a little about camp and more:   Sean Lee's latest injury only confirms what many of us have been worried about since his move to SAM linebacker was announced for 2019  TE Blake Jarwin is returning for his third season and, after bolstering his value to the team in 2018, he's moving nicely, but will Witten's return negatively affect him?   The Cowboys signed RB Alfred Morris this week, raising concerns about the team's commitment to Ezekiel Elliott; should we be concerned by this?   Ezekiel Elliott heads to Mexico during his holdout, Jerry Jones states in an interview that DAL doesn't need a ""rushing champion to win a Super Bowl,"" and an extended discussion on Zeke's perspective, the team's perspective, and how the NFL may change in the coming years as a result of situations like the one Zeke finds himself in this year  As we roll thru our second month of Cowboys Weekly, things are looking up. Our listener count is steadily increasing week over week and that's entirely because of you!

Great Value Investor Joel Greenblatt Explains	 Great value investor Joel Greenblatt reveals his two secrets to investment success. He is living proof that active management can still work really well. Greenblatt is Managing Principal and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Gotham Asset Management where he co-manages hedge funds and several hedge fund-like mutual funds utilizing long/short strategies. His behavioral insight that the best investment strategy is one that both makes sense and that you can stick with. The proposition that active management still works can be made on a case by case basis in the highly competitive stock mutual fund business, but it doesn’t hold up in general. In Greenblatt’s opinion: the investment flows to passive will continue, but there is a silver lining to this trend, which he will explain.

He's a leader who's interested in culture over process and I thought I'd talk to him about this focus to help companies trying to bring in planning understand that you can't just drop in a planner and have planning. Planning happens within an operating system - a city, an agency type, an agency, the philosophy of the agency, the processes of the agency, and the attitudes of managers.   We discuss: - Establishing a good culture of planning - The pressures on planners right now - Managing up - Mental health in planning' - The APG and its creative planning awards  Shoutouts to all the lone planners or people trying to establish planning where it has never existed.

I went up the canyon hoping to be alone with God and pray for an hour, but I ran out of things to say in ten minutes. Then, a speaker came to my college ward who struck me as a woman with wonderful faith, and so I asked if I could go visit with her at her home and if she could teach me what she knew. But things began to open up for me when I read what Paul wrote in the magnificent Hebrews 11 about faith. Let’s explore today. 	34.10633333333333	show_2Mkrfx6HroyJiFjCnSRkOF	6Tt4OdhAL6AXoiYKPH4BTt

One dominant market observation of the last decade has been that we have been experiencing the least believed bull market in history. As of August of 2018 the market’s advance, in large-cap stocks at least, had indeed become the longest bull market in history. But the experience of investors has been anything but a straight shot. If you look at indexes outside the largest U.S. company stocks it has been a much more perilous ride with several major corrections along the way. The Russell 2000, which is used as a proxy for small company stocks is a case in point. It has experienced three major reversals in the last decade. This week’s guest operates in the sweet spot of the current market, large-company stocks, but he is advising caution to his clients. He is a widely followed market strategist and successful investor, Robert Doll, senior portfolio manager and chief equity strategist at Nuveen.  Doll is famous for his frequently accurate list of 10 annual predictions forecasting the market, economic, interest rate, and political trends among others With the economic recovery now the longest on record and slowing, how worried is he about a recession?

Only 23% of actively managed funds in all major categories, including stocks, bonds, and real estate outperformed their passive index fund rivals over the last ten years. And only about 8% of U.S. large-cap funds outperformed passive, the smallest margin among all active fund categories winners.  No wonder that active U.S. stock funds are experiencing substantial outflows and passive stock funds are gaining assets. In a historic shift, passive assets in U.S. equity funds recently surpassed those in actively managed ones for the first time ever. This week’s guests are bucking all of those trends. They are active managers in primarily large-cap U.S. stocks. They have been beating the market and peers by substantial margins over the last decade and they are attracting more assets.

The TEAM, the TEAM, the TEAM."""	"""Your team is only as strong as your weakest skater and how your league treats its weakest skaters says a lot about your league."" I heard this statement earlier this week and it's been bouncing around in my brain ever since. Sometimes leagues focus so hard on chasing a dream, a number on a website that says how good they are, that it's a challenge to bring others up with them. And then when turnover inevitably happens, they don't have the next people ready to join the A travel team. More teams are addressing this now with a mixed charter combining A and B levels in larger leagues, but many are still stuck with this problem. And for smaller leagues who will never have many people to pull from, it can mean nearly starting over anytime a handful of people have to step away at once.  This episode is a deep dive mostly into the perspective of a small to mid-size league where I've had the most experience and the tough lessons learned along the way. I share a couple stories of skaters that have inspired me with their dedication. And I talk in depth about how we work to reach skaters of multiple skill levels and what we have learned along the way to value every individual who is a part of our league.  📷 Crow's Feet Photo & Design We love roller derby and talking about roller derby!

"This episode, I was joined by Grant Porteous, Owner/Life Coach & Consultant at Intentional Life Coaching & Consulting to learn about how to conquer and change self limiting beliefs. It turns out there is a LOT of science behind our ability as humans to rewire our brains and set ourselves on new neural pathways to success. We form 90% of our beliefs by age 7 based on experience. You have an experience, you assess the experience, reinforce it with an emotion, and come to a decision or belief about the experience which then becomes wired into your brain and informs your other experiences going forward depending on how impactful it was. Over time, you will see more and more experiences as aligning with your already developed belief and reinforcing it and not notice the evidence that goes against your belief. (Ex: ""I'm no good at relationships; Dogs don't like me; Things work out for other people but not for me; If you want something done right, you must do it yourself, etc.) But NO MORE! It doesn't have to BE this way! We are going to cover FOUR STEPS to replace negative beliefs that limit us with positive beliefs that will allow action and give us room to grow and learn. We also talk a bit about visualization as an important way to cement that new vision of what you want in your mind. Have a question for Grant? E-mail grant@grantporteous.com. 📷by ©Mark Sheehan 2012 (This photo perfectly captured how much confidence I had about jamming in 2012, how much I wish I had known how to change my beliefs back then!)

In fact, after growing up bouncing around, getting expelled twice, living in America, West Sussex, and Sydney, and constantly seeking new experiences and new ideas, maybe she came to the realization she didn't fit in anywhere and then she had to work out how to create the thing in which she fitted. But now that this is written here, she'll probably defy it. So, whatever.

That is what financial thought leader Richard Bernstein is suggesting to clients. In a recent report, aptly titled: Investing for December 31, 2029 -The End of Globalization, he makes his case. And yes, he is talking about 2029! As he notes in his report: “Market leadership always changes decade by decade, and the leadership of the past decade, which are now lauded as ‘core investments,’ seem highly unlikely to be the leadership of the next decade.” If he is correct, which he has been frequently over the years, thinking about investing for 2029 is probably a healthy exercise. Richard Bernstein is Chief Executive and Chief Investment Officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors, which he founded in 2009. It now oversees or advises over 9 billion dollars in assets, largely in multi-asset allocation strategies using ETFs for financial advisors.

It’s Matthew 24 where Christ during his last week on earth told his apostles just what to expect before He would return. Here’s the next question: 2)  Do we have any precedent in the Gospel or in history where a people were preparing for the coming of the Lord; they knew He was coming; they knew where He was coming; they even prepared a place for Him to come—and then He came?  Of course we see this in the Book of Mormon—but is the same pattern happening in our time?  We’re going to explore this question in this podcast. 	31.50585	show_2Mkrfx6HroyJiFjCnSRkOF	7CP8vbeaxNxO6Xk3EKOJiQ

Together we discuss 7 big ways to lose your team's trust (the 7 Deadly Sins of Coaching if you will). Trust is not something you automatically get when you decide to become a coach. Trust has to be earned. And it can be easily lost if you lose your way and slip up. We'll discuss the flip side, how to avoid these pitfalls and honestly communicate with the members of your team.
